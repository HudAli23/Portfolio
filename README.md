# Hi, I'm Huddaifah

Software Engineer | CS Graduate  
I build **production‑minded software** with a focus on **clean architecture, maintainable code, and systems that are easy to run, test, and demo**.

---

## About Me

I’m focused on becoming a strong software engineer by practicing:
- **Designing maintainable systems** (clear boundaries, reusable components, readable code)
- **Building end‑to‑end applications** (UI → logic → persistence → outputs)
- **Reliability & debugging** (logging, error handling, predictable behavior)
- **Developer experience** (good README docs, setup steps, reproducible runs)

## Featured Software Engineering Projects

### 🏗️ Evergreen Estate (PHP + MySQL)
A full CRUD web application for managing **agents**, **clients**, **properties (with image uploads)**, and **appointments**.

**Software engineering highlights**
- Modeled a **relational domain** with linked entities (agents ↔ clients ↔ properties ↔ appointments)
- Built user workflows with **create / read / update / delete** operations across multiple pages
- Implemented **file upload handling** + cleanup on delete (property images)
- Added **data integrity guardrails** (prevent deleting referenced agents)

**Tech**
- PHP (mysqli), MySQL, Bootstrap

**Repo**
- `https://github.com/HudAli23/Evergreen-Estate`

### ⛏️ Get in the Mine Shaft (Android / Kotlin)
An Android productivity app built with modern Android components.

**Software engineering highlights**
- Compose UI with **multi‑screen navigation** and structured screen ownership
- **Room persistence layer** + repository pattern for data access
- **Hilt dependency injection** to keep construction and wiring clean
- ViewModels + Flow for **predictable state/data flow**

**Tech**
- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, WorkManager

**Repo**
- `https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>`

### 🧠 OBC — Organized By Classification (Python)
A content-first file organization tool (GUI) that scans files, extracts text (including OCR), classifies them, and organizes them into structured folders.

**Software engineering highlights**
- Designed a clear pipeline: **validate → scan → extract → classify → organize**
- Built for reliability with **logging**, safe moves (conflict handling), and fallbacks
- Config-driven behavior to reduce hard-coded rules and improve maintainability
- Structured modules to support future extension (new file types, new classifiers)

**Tech**
- Python, Tkinter, PyMuPDF, pytesseract, Transformers (with fallbacks)

**Repo**
- `https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>`

### 📈 URS — University Ranking Classification (Python)
A reproducible ML pipeline that generates evaluation artifacts (reports + plots). Included because it demonstrates engineering discipline in a data pipeline.

**Software engineering highlights**
- Built an end-to-end pipeline with clear stages and saved outputs
- Reproducible setup via requirements + consistent output directory
- Evaluation artifacts are generated automatically for reviewers

**Tech**
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn

**Repo**
- `https://github.com/HudAli23/University-Ranking-Classification`
